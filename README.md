## Software
* All experiments are implemented in [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (version 4.1.2)

* The model is fitted using a Bayesian approach that is implemented with [rstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan) package in R

* [Bayesplot](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/bayesplot) is used for posterior checking of the fitted Bayesian model

## Code
* R code and the stan script for model compilation can be found in the __Code__ folder

* Notice that there are two R script files and two stan script files:
